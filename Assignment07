Functions
Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to explain the concepts learned in Module 07 on functions, specifically the 3 types 1) scalar, 2) inline table-value, and 3) multi-statement table-value.
Explain when you would use a SQL UDF.
SQL functions can either be built-in functions or user defined functions (UDFs). UDFs are custom functions and can be used when built-in functions donâ€™t provide the specific functionality we need. An example of when a UDF would be used is for check constraints, see Figure 1.

Explain the differences between Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
There are 3 types of UDFs, scalar, inline table-value, and multi-statement table-value. Both inline and multi-statement are table-value meaning they return tables as outputs while scalar functions return a single value. The difference between inline and multi-statement is multi-statement can accept more than one statement. 
The 3 types also differ in their syntax. For scalar, there needs to be a return/end block and the schema name must be included, see Figure 2a. For inline, there is no return/end block, see Figure 2b. For multi-statement, there needs to be a return/end block, see Figure 2c.

Summary
To recap, Module 07 focuses on the different types of functions and this paper specifically addresses UDFs, when they are used and the different types of UDFs.
